# Video SDK Workshop

This repository is to assist with the Zoom Video SDk Workshop being presented at DevWorld 2024.

This Lab will walk you through setting up an end to end meeting session using the Zoom Video SDK.  
Video SDK is a session based model separate from Zoom accounts, which connects two or more users so they can communicate using Zoom's backbone infrastructure. Zooms Video SDK provides video, audio, screen sharing, chat, data streams, and more, as a service. You can build with all of these features, or pick and choose. The Video SDK comes with a full set of server side APIs and webhooks.
This guide is intended to be used as a learning reference for how to embed Zooms Video SDK within a React web application. The lab will walk you through using zooms new UI Toolkit (https://github.com/zoom/videosdk-ui-toolkit-web) which is a prebuilt video chat user interface built from zoom and designed to help demo and get started quickly with the Video SDK.  The lab will also walk you through using Video SDK APIs within postman to read data.
